# NaiveBayes
This is a c implementation of the Machine Learning algorithm called Naive Bayes Gaussian. 
It's been adapted from the python version in: http://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-classifier-scratch-python/
It will be used in the Embbeded System Module at IFCE.

To get it up and running, execute the following steps:
1. Select a dataset by commenting/uncommenting the datasets define section at the defines.h file;
2. Run the training/main.c file to generate the training files;
3. Run the prediction/main.c file to see accuracy, recall, precision etc;
